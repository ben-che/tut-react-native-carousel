# React Native ScrollView Carousel
React Native doesn't have a built in carousel, and I assume that Bootstrap ain't gonna come along for another few years, so here's my attempt at building one:

## Pre-reqs
Download [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) so you can skip the setup and dive into learning.

If you choose to `npm run eject`, you need Xcode. If you don't `npm run eject`, you need to download Expo on your device.

Alternatively, `npm run ios` `npm run andriod` allows you to run the app on a simulator if one is installed
